📊 Project Title: EDA on Indian Car Sales Dataset


📝 Project Description:


This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used car sales in India. The objective is to understand key patterns and insights in the second-hand automobile market based on features like brand, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and price.

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project includes data cleaning, feature exploration, visualization, and summary statistics to answer business-relevant questions and identify trends in pricing, demand, and vehicle condition.

🔍 Key Analyses & Insights:

✅ Distribution of car brands sold in India

✅ Comparison between manual and automatic transmission vehicles

✅ Fuel type trends (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)

✅ Average price vs. year of manufacturing

✅ Total owners vs. selling price distribution

✅ Count of Accidental vs. Non-Accidental cars

✅ Relationship between kilometers driven and price
